# Connect DUO
Roster: Ahnaf Hasan, Adil Gondal

## What is Connect DUO?
Do you have friends? Do you want to show them why you are the best at Connect 4? Do you want to then lose said friends? Then Connect DUO is the game for you! Connect DUO features a 1v1 style battle between you and your friend to see who is the best Connector! With realistic graphics and state of the art ray tracing, you shove your pixelated win all in your friend's face! Losing the game? No you are not! Pull the plug and shutdown the server, causing the other games to crash! Take that Jared!

# Sounds amazing! What do I need to play it?
Absolutely nothing! All it requires is the C compiler for Linux and the standard library! That's all folks!

## Makefile
Go to the ```sys``` folder. Run ```make```. Open a terminal to be the server. Navigate to the ```sys``` directory and run ```./server```. Open two terminals to be the clients. Naviagate to the ```sys``` directory and run ```./client```. Beat yourself in Connect 4. Run ```make clean``` to get rid of all evidence of your loss.
